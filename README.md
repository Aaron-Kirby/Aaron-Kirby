### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on shoring up my coding skills and learning different languages
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help deciding which languages/skills will be the most useful and which order to learn them in
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once pet a shark in Belize. It felt like sandpaper! I also saw a barracuda - didn't pet that one :cold_sweat:
