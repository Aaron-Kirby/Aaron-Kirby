### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on shoring up my coding skills and learning different languages
     - :muscle: My current list includes SQL, python, R, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help deciding which languages/skills will be the most useful and which order to learn them in
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once pet a shark in Belize. It felt like sandpaper! I also saw a barracuda - didn't pet that one :cold_sweat:
