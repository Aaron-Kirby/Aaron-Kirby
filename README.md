# 👋 Hello! Nice to see you.
Welcome to my page!  
I'm Aaron Kirby, Full Stack Developer currently living in Buckeye, AZ.

- ⚔️: I deleted old repos and am adding updated repos both for my own benefit and for potential employers to peruse.
- 📘: I’m currently working on a React project
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once pet a shark in Belize. It felt like sandpaper! I also saw a barracuda - didn't pet that one :cold_sweat:
